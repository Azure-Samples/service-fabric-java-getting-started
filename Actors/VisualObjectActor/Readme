# Visual Objects
This sample project uses Paper.js to render a set of objects. Each object is represented by an Actor, where the location and trajectory of each is calculated on the server side by the Actor representing the object. 
 
 ## How to run Visual Objects
This sample creates multiple Visual actor which keeps on moving in the plane.
To build the application execute gradle. You can install the built application
by running `install.sh` or `install-sfctl.sh`. If using the Azure Service
Fabric command line, use `install-sfctl.sh`. Once the application has started, go to [http://localhost:8507/index.html](http://localhost:8507/index.html). Try opening it in multiple browser windows or on multiple machines to see how the server-side calculation produces the same result on every screen.
